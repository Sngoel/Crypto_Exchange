I believe these are all the commands required to run the web app

-> Open Terminal 
-> move into 0x431 Directory where app.py is
-> "pip install virtualenv" (Only if you dont have virtual environment installed)
-> "source 0x431/bin/activate" (activates the virtualenv, you will need to run this everytime you exit out of the terminal)
-> "pip install flask" (only have to do this once)
-> "pip install wtforms" (only have to do this once)
-> "pip install passlib" (only have to do this once)
*I think these are all of the libraries you need as of 1/26, if you dont have all of them you will get an error saying which one you need*
-> "python app.py" (hopefully you have the lastest version of python, if not upgrade dat)
-> go to "localhost:5000"
